##Cockpit Log Plugin
This plugin allows to view logs from kibana per process instances in case if logs have tracing info like process instance business key, activity id, activity name in their header. You could achieve this behavior using project [Sleuth](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth) of version 3 and higher.

The plugin adds Logs tab to Process Definition and Process Instance view pages.
